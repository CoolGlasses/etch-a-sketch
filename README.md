# etch-a-sketch

This repository is for the Etch-a-Sketch Project from The Odin Project Curriculum

In this project I originally explored utilizing Flexbox to create the grid GUI for the Etch-a-Sketch.  This required me to created nested For loops in my script file in an attempt to create the appropriate number of columns and rows, as well as allow for the user the ability to stipulate the number themselves.  This proved troublesome, as the heights of the "cells" were difficult to manage and ultimately utilizing Flexbox proved unseccessful.  

After making inquiries to the Odin Project community about attempting to solve my Flexbox "cell" height problem, I decided to refactor the solution utilizing CSS Grid.  This quickly proved the more appropriate methodology and resulted in the primary file tree that exists today.  In order to fully implement CSS Grid, I discovered CSS Variables and how Javascript can manipulate them.  I believe this to be a critical component of my education as it allows for a much more dynamic and customizable user experience with future projects.
